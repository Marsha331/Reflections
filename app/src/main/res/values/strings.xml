    <string name="dance_text">DANCE CHOREOGRAPHY is the act of creating movement. The choreographer (student submitting entry) may
be the performer or one of the performers, but the choreographer does not have to perform in the entry.
2016-2017 Theme: What Is Your Story?
Consider the following styles and ensembles to portray your original choreography: Ballet, contemporary, ethnic
and folk, freestyle, hip hop, jazz, street dance, and tap.
Originality: Only new and original choreography inspired by the theme may be submitted. Each entry must be
the work of one student only.
Consider use of background song(s), props and the location to show a clear relation of the dance
choreography to the theme. An explanation of the origin of the dance and/or the significance of the
choreography might be a useful addition to the artist statement when submitting a dance choreography entry
that involves traditional, cultural or regional dances. Whether an entry displays formal dance technique or a
simple approach, it will be judged primarily on how well the student uses his or her artistic vision to portray
the theme, originality and creativity.
Copyright: Use of copyrighted material is prohibited. Plagiarized entries will be disqualified. Use of
background music must be cited on the student entry form.
Presentation: Video must not exceed 5 minutes in length and 1GB (one gigabyte) in file size.
Ideas for Audio/Visual Quality: Use a tripod to hold the camera still. Make sure there is plenty of lighting,
especially if shooting indoors. Turn off all noise-making devices in the room (air conditioners, fans, telephones,
etc.). Record a short test and watch it. If needed, change the record volume or microphone location. Make
sure the background music (if any) is audible on the recording. Allow for two seconds of silence at the
beginning and end of your recording.
Packaging:
• Accepted video file formats include: AVI, MOV, MPG, MPEG, MP4, WMV, FLV and F4V.
